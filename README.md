# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Project 3 Frontend

## Welcome to Stock Trakr

A stock tracking app that lets you input your building layout and create rooms directly in the UI to start storing your stock. It allows you to add items to your rooms and perform cycle counts when needed. For large offices and small homes alike.

A project by Patrick Kok and Hong Yun

# User Stories

Emily: Managing the logistics at work is a tough job, it is harder that the software is confusing and limiting. There's is no inbuilt way to create new room layouts and I have to create an IT ticket to slightly change the layout. The UI is also hard to navigate, making it hard to onboard new talent who may not have seen the programe we use before.

Bob: Organising the house has been hard, we used to use Excel sheets to track items but they are hard to maintain with the amount of manual work needed to add items and do cycle counts. We are slipping behind on updating our tracker that we are starting to think it is not worth the effort.
